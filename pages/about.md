i2i is a literary and illustrative magazine, full of art, poetry, and interesting interviews! We are inspired by the ever-growing lack of physical media, and the want to preserve and share new art. Our Team produces and distributes our magazine throughout Long Beach, for free!

For every edition we sell DIGITAL COPIES (for our friends outside of Long Beach) and PHYSICAL COPIES for delivery to anywhere in the world. Sales costs help us distribute editions for free, letting us spread and share the work of our talented submitters! If you’re a writer, illustrator, poet, songwriter, or any other creative: WE WANT YOU! If you’re interested in:
