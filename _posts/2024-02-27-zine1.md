Our very first edition of i2i! We are literary and illustrative zine full of community collected art. Our Team produces and distributes our zine throughout Long Beach, for free! We are inspired by the ever-growing lack of physical media and the want to spread the love for our local artists as far as we can. The 1st edition includes original poetry, artwork, short stories, and 2 interviews with Long Beach creatives. Available for purchase in digital or physical copies.
